# Deploying & Managing Mac's in a Lab Environment

A copy of the presentation, and links to resources from [MacAdmins - Deploying & Managing Macs in Lab Environment](https://apple.lib.utah.edu/april-2022-macadmins-meeting/) talk, based on my Jamf Deployment blog post series: https://irritatedsysadmin.substack.com/p/fully-automated-lab-imac-deployment-with-jamf-pro-ade-part-6-post-series-summary


## Description

Deploying Apple devices can come with challenges. Deploying them in a multi-user lab environment can come with far more. But what happens when you can’t be there all night, and you need to deploy or refresh an entire lab of machines?

In this session, we’ll go through what it takes to create a true zero-touch deployment for a multi-user lab environment. From brand new in box to user ready. When we’re finished, all you’ll need to do is plug it in.
